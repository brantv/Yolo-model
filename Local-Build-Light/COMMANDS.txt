Detecting image:
darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data cfg/yolov3-custom.cfg ../../Yolo-supplemental-files/yolov3-custom_1000.weights

Note: you have to find the location of yolov3-custom_1000.weights on your computer, it won't be in the same location as mine.  It was downloaded in the bitbucket, so point the command line at that directory

Upon running this command, requests image path.
Ex:
" data/button_test.png "
or
" C:/Users/you/downloads/pic.png "
